How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You don't have to wade through many lines of code which have not changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?
	
    You can learn from past mistakes or changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

    Cons are that you will forget.  Pros are that commits will have a logical meaning.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They are probably predominantly used for different purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    See the list of commits with git log and view the differences between any two 
    commits with git diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could 
break something?

    You can always go back to a previous working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control.
